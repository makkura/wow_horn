WoW Horn
This project is an old example application made using Appcelerator Titanium when it did not support mobile apps and was only able usable for desktop style apps.

Titanium allowed the use web languages to develop desktop applications.
It also allowed some scripting languages such as Ruby to mix in to the application and be accessible by Javascript.

This is an example using normal front end code [HTML, CSS, and Javascript] to give an interface and call ruby code that accessed WoW's Armory website to gather character achievements and post messages about them to twitter.

At this point, Appcelerator's Titanium only supports mobile platforms (the desktop support is now a project called TideSDK), Twitter's API has been tightened and does not allow simple http post requests to post messages on their service.
I'm sure the Armory layout has also changed.
In short, this prjoect has no hope of running and exists for archive purposes only
